This is the core WAMI library.  It provides the necessary classes to
host a Javascript API for speech web-interfaces.  The API can be
hosted via a J2EE servlet, such as the one provided in the
wami-example source tree.

Once hosted on Tomcat, wami-example can then be utilized by 3rd party
developers who wish to write client-side code against it.
Alternatively, you can extend from it yourself with an application
specific J2EE servlet.
