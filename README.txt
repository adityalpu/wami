This is the core Wami library.  It provides the necessary base classes
of a web application, which can be hosted on a J2EE servlet container
such as Tomcat, to provide a Javascript API for speech web-interfaces.

The "wami-example" source code provides a sample Dynamic Web Project for
Eclipse, which makes use of this library.  Once hosted on Tomcat, 
wami-example can then be utilized by 3rd party developers who wish 
to write client-side code against it. Alternatively, you can extend from 
it yourself with an application specific J2EE servlet.
